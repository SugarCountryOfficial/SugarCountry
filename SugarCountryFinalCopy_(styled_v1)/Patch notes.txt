Leaderboard added:
	* Needs to be centered in CSS. Too tired to figure out how to do it.

v2 additions:
	-leaderboard CSS fixed so status bar no longer goes off screen
	-html divs to add in characters' chosen icons within their HUD
	-Coloring for the Special and 'SUPER' Special tiles (still needs functionality)
	-added a CSS class that can be assigned to whichever player's turn it is
	-Player numbers represented on the board (I figured it'd be way too small to draw
	the players icons onto the game board)

Minor fixes:
	-Working on fixing issue where having two players on the same tile makes the leaderboard appear blank.
		-Taking a LOT longer than I expected. Keep finding more issues the further i go with this. Code is getting VERY long.
	-Attempted to start saving player icon selection from main menu to input it into the gameboard.
	-Gave the game a slight off-white background color to make it less blank. Can be changed easily if you do not like it.
		-Noted the gameboard is not centered but the player selection area and the leaderboard are. Could you even that out please? Thank you!
	-Started to fiddle with the special tiles.
